Welcome to the website of BEC4! Our research focuses on exploring the world of spinful ultracold atoms, where many new and interesting phenomena occur.

We have a newly constructed Rubidium quantum gas microscope! Using a high-resolution objective lens, we can detect the positions of single atoms trapped in an optical lattice. This advance has opened the door to studies of quantum simulation and atom-light interfaces in new regimes.
